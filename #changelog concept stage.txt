13.10.2021 (DD/MM/YYYY) 0.1.1
	Fixes
		- If $bWaitForFloodPrevention was set to True (Default) in _netcode_TCPSend() while the function waited for the Partners
		Buffer to be empty enough to quo up new data, but the socket disconnected in the mean time, then the Func became stuck
		and threw alot of errors. This is fixed. The func now checks if the socket still exists before it calls
		_netcode_RecvManageExecute() and if not then returns @extended = 1 and "Socket is no longer known or disconnected" if
		the Tracer is enabled.
	
	Changes
		- __netcode_SendPacketQuo() was recoded and __netcode_TCPSend() got the optional param to no longer wait for 'send' to
		succeed. __netcode_SendPacketQuo() was recoded in a way that the func will no longer block until the quod data is send.
		The UDF now much better utilizes the non blocking feature. So a slower client, in terms of internet speed or latency,
		will no longer slow down the speed of the others. However __netcode_SendPacketQuo() is marked for recoding because its
		current codework is inefficient.
		
	Upgrades
		- Duo to the changes of the packet quo and tcp send feature the UDF got faster:
			'netcode' managemode got up to ~71 MB/s
			'rawlinked' managemode got up to ~210 MB/s
