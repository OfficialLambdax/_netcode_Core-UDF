Template Note
**************************************************************************************************************
First of all, the libary is still in its Concept Phase and as such there are bugs, flaws, unused code and more things that arent properly implemented yet. No one should assume that the libary, in its current state, is any secure against the various attacks that can come from the Internet. So using the libary for important tasks and / or to secure sensitive data is not a good decision. However if you find or notice a security flaw or a exploit, that range from remote code execution, to buffer overflows or to other intrusions that can cause harm to the executing machine, the server or the clients of the server, then please report the found flaw here.
