# _netcode-UDF
a extended TCP/TLS/IPv4/IPv6 UDF for Autoit3

DO NOT USE
This lib is neither a stable release nor a Beta or a Alpha. This isnt even a prerelease. The lib is still in the concept creation phase.
It is unsafe to use, major and minior bugs exists. Everything is subject to change.

There is little to zero documentation and no support for anything. I just uploaded it here for me to have access to it from everyhwere and to speak with other devs about certain ideas.
