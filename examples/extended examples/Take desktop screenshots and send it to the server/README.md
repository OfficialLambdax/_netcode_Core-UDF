The Server creates a GUI for every connected client and shows its send pictures.

Im a horrible frontend developer and have no clue how gui events work. So the buttons are very unresponsive.
Also beaware that the _screenshot.au3 is inefficient and is just not able to create a solid amount of pictures per second.
