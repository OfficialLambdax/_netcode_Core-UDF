Connecting to a given IP and the Port is usually blocking and therefore can be very slow in a single threaded environment, like within Autoit.

_netcode provides access to non blocking connect calls and to show it off a little better, i couldnt thing of another example, i coded a little port scanner.

The example will simply the check the given IP and the given port range for open ports and writes the successfull connect attempts to a file.

Dont run the software against the ip of another, not owned by you, computer. That might not be legal in your country.
